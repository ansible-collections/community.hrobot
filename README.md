This repository contains the `community.hrobot` Ansible Collection. The collection includes modules to work with [Hetzner's Robot](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/).

You can find [documentation for the modules and plugins in this collection here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/community/hrobot/).

## Using this collection

Before using the General community collection, you need to install the collection with the `ansible-galaxy` CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install community.hrobot

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
- name: community.hrobot
```

See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

## Contributing to this collection

If you want to develop new content for this collection or improve what is already here, the easiest way to work on the collection is to clone it into one of the configured [`COLLECTIONS_PATH`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#collections-paths), and work on it there.

You can find more information in the [developer guide for collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections.html#contributing-to-collections), and in the [Ansible Community Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/index.html).
