          the same value as ``whitelist_hos``. The old name ``whitelist_hos`` will
          be removed eventually (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/15).
        - robot module utils - add ``allow_empty_result`` parameter to ``plugin_open_url_json``

    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - robot inventory plugin - do not crash if a server neither has name or primary
          IP set. Instead, fall back to using the server's number as the name. This
          can happen if unnamed rack reservations show up in your server list (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/40,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/47).

  1.8.0:
    changes:
      major_changes:
        - firewall - Hetzner added output rules support to the firewall. This change
          unfortunately means that using old versions of the firewall module will
          always set the output rule list to empty, thus disallowing the server to
          send out packets (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/75,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/76).
      minor_changes:
        - firewall, firewall_info - add ``filter_ipv6`` and ``rules.output`` output
          to support the new IPv6 filtering and output rules features (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/75,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/76).
        - firewall, firewall_info - add ``server_number`` option that can be used
          instead of ``server_ip`` to identify the server. Hetzner deprecated configuring
          the firewall by ``server_ip``, so using ``server_ip`` will stop at some
          point in the future (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/77).
      release_summary: Feature release for the Hetzner firewall changes.

  1.8.1:
    changes:
      known_issues:
        - Ansible markup will show up in raw form on ansible-doc text output for ansible-core
          before 2.15. If you have trouble deciphering the documentation markup, please
          upgrade to ansible-core 2.15 (or newer), or read the HTML documentation
          on https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/community/hrobot/.
      release_summary: 'Maintenance release with updated documentation.


        From this version on, community.hrobot is using the new `Ansible semantic
        markup

        <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html#semantic-markup-within-module-documentation>`__

        in its documentation. If you look at documentation with the ansible-doc CLI
        tool

        from ansible-core before 2.15, please note that it does not render the markup

        correctly. You should be still able to read it in most cases, but you need

        ansible-core 2.15 or later to see it as it is intended. Alternatively you
        can

        look at `the devel docsite <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/community/hrobot/>`__

        for the rendered HTML version of the documentation of the latest release.

      minor_changes:
        - robot inventory plugin - the ``filters`` option has been renamed to ``simple_filters``.
          The old name still works until community.hrobot 2.0.0. Then it will change
          to allow more complex filtering with the ``community.library_inventory_filtering_v1``

    changes:
      release_summary: Bugfix release.
      security_fixes:
        - robot inventory plugin - make sure all data received from the Hetzner robot
          service server is marked as unsafe, so remote code execution by obtaining
          texts that can be evaluated as templates is not possible (https://www.die-welt.net/2024/03/remote-code-execution-in-ansible-dynamic-inventory-plugins/,

      bugfixes:
        - inventory plugins - add unsafe wrapper to avoid marking strings that do
          not contain ``{`` or ``}`` as unsafe, to work around a bug in AWX (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/102).

  2.0.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - robot inventory plugin - ``filters`` is now no longer an alias of ``simple_filters``,
          but a new, different option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).
      major_changes:
        - The ``community.hrobot`` collection now depends on the ``community.library_inventory_filtering_v1``
          collection. This utility collection provides host filtering functionality
          for inventory plugins. If you use the Ansible community package, both collections
          are included and you do not have to do anything special. If you install
          the collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install``, it will be installed
          automatically. If you install the collection by copying the files of the
          collection to a place where ansible-core can find it, for example by cloning
          the git repository, you need to make sure that you also have to install
          the dependency if you are using the inventory plugin (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).
      minor_changes:
        - robot inventory plugin - add ``filter`` option which allows to include and
          exclude hosts based on Jinja2 conditions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).
      release_summary: New major release 2.0.0.
      removed_features:
        - The collection no longer supports Ansible, ansible-base, and ansible-core
          releases that are currently End of Life at the time of the 2.0.0 release.
          This means that Ansible 2.9, ansible-base 2.10, ansible-core 2.11, ansible-core
          2.12, and ansible-core 2.13 are no longer supported. The collection might
          still work with these versions, but it can stop working at any moment without
          advance notice, and this will not be considered a bug (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).
