          name as alias (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/15).
        - firewall, firewall_info - add return value ``allowlist_hos``, which contains
          the same value as ``whitelist_hos``. The old name ``whitelist_hos`` will
          be removed eventually (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/15).
        - robot module utils - add ``allow_empty_result`` parameter to ``plugin_open_url_json``

      bugfixes:
        - robot inventory plugin - do not crash if a server neither has name or primary
          IP set. Instead, fall back to using the server's number as the name. This
          can happen if unnamed rack reservations show up in your server list (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/40,

  1.8.0:
    changes:
      major_changes:
        - firewall - Hetzner added output rules support to the firewall. This change
          unfortunately means that using old versions of the firewall module will
          always set the output rule list to empty, thus disallowing the server to
          send out packets (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/75,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/76).
      minor_changes:
        - firewall, firewall_info - add ``filter_ipv6`` and ``rules.output`` output
          to support the new IPv6 filtering and output rules features (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/75,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/76).
        - firewall, firewall_info - add ``server_number`` option that can be used
          instead of ``server_ip`` to identify the server. Hetzner deprecated configuring
          the firewall by ``server_ip``, so using ``server_ip`` will stop at some
          point in the future (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/77).

    changes:
      known_issues:
        - Ansible markup will show up in raw form on ansible-doc text output for ansible-core
          before 2.15. If you have trouble deciphering the documentation markup, please
          upgrade to ansible-core 2.15 (or newer), or read the HTML documentation
          on https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/community/hrobot/.
      release_summary: 'Maintenance release with updated documentation.


        From this version on, community.hrobot is using the new `Ansible semantic
        markup

        <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html#semantic-markup-within-module-documentation>`__

        in its documentation. If you look at documentation with the ansible-doc CLI
        tool

        from ansible-core before 2.15, please note that it does not render the markup

        correctly. You should be still able to read it in most cases, but you need

        ansible-core 2.15 or later to see it as it is intended. Alternatively you
        can

        look at `the devel docsite <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/community/hrobot/>`__

          service server is marked as unsafe, so remote code execution by obtaining

    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - robot inventory plugin - ``filters`` is now no longer an alias of ``simple_filters``,
          but a new, different option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).
      major_changes:
        - The ``community.hrobot`` collection now depends on the ``community.library_inventory_filtering_v1``
          collection. This utility collection provides host filtering functionality
          for inventory plugins. If you use the Ansible community package, both collections
          are included and you do not have to do anything special. If you install
          the collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install``, it will be installed
          automatically. If you install the collection by copying the files of the
          collection to a place where ansible-core can find it, for example by cloning
          the git repository, you need to make sure that you also have to install
          the dependency if you are using the inventory plugin (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).
      minor_changes:
        - robot inventory plugin - add ``filter`` option which allows to include and
          exclude hosts based on Jinja2 conditions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).
      release_summary: New major release 2.0.0.
      removed_features:
        - The collection no longer supports Ansible, ansible-base, and ansible-core
          releases that are currently End of Life at the time of the 2.0.0 release.
          This means that Ansible 2.9, ansible-base 2.10, ansible-core 2.11, ansible-core
          2.12, and ansible-core 2.13 are no longer supported. The collection might
          still work with these versions, but it can stop working at any moment without
          advance notice, and this will not be considered a bug (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).

    changes:
      deprecated_features:
        - boot - the various ``arch`` suboptions have been deprecated and will be
          removed from community.hrobot 3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/134).
      minor_changes:
        - All modules and plugins now have a ``rate_limit_retry_timeout`` option,
          which allows to configure for how long to wait in case of rate limiting
          errors. By default, the modules wait indefinitely. Setting the option to
          ``0`` does not retry (this was the behavior in previous versions), and a
          positive value sets a number of seconds to wait at most (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/140).
        - boot - it is now possible to specify SSH public keys in ``authorized_keys``.
          The fingerprint needed by the Robot API will be extracted automatically
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/134).
        - v_switch - the module is now part of the ``community.hrobot.robot`` action
          group, despite already being documented as part of it (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/136).

    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - robot inventory plugin - avoid using deprecated option when templating options
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/165).
      known_issues:
        - 'storagebox* modules - the Hetzner Robot API for storage boxes is `deprecated
          and will be sunset on July 30, 2025 <https://docs.hetzner.cloud/changelog#2025-06-25-new-api-for-storage-boxes>`__.
          The modules are currently not compatible with the new API. We will try to
          adjust them until then, but usage and return values might change slightly
          due to differences in the APIs.

          For the new API, an API token needs to be registered and provided as ``hetzner_token``
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/166).'
      minor_changes:
        - Introduced a new action group (module defaults group) ``community.hrobot.api``
          that includes all modules that support the new Hetzner API. This is currently
          limited to a subset of the storage box modules; these currently support
          both the ``community.hrobot.robot`` and the new ``community.hrobot.api``
          action group, and will eventually drop the ``community.hrobot.robot`` action
          group once the Robot API for storage boxes is removed by Hetzner (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/166,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/167, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/168,

      release_summary: 'Feature and bugfix release.


        This release adds support for the `new Hetzner API for the storage box modules

        <https://docs.hetzner.cloud/changelog#2025-06-25-new-api-for-storage-boxes>`__.

        You need to use ``hetzner_token`` instead of ``hetzner_user``/``hetzner_password``

        to use the new API. Please note that the old API will be sunset on July 30th,
        2025;

        the modules will then stop working if you do not provide ``hetzner_token``
        and stop

        providing ``hetzner_user``/``hetzner_password``.'
