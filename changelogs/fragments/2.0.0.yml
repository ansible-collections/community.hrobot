  ...
major_changes:
  - The ``community.hrobot`` collection now depends on the ``community.library_inventory_filtering_v1``
    collection. This utility collection provides host filtering functionality
    for inventory plugins. If you use the Ansible community package, both collections
    are included and you do not have to do anything special. If you install the
    collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install``, it will be installed
    automatically. If you install the collection by copying the files of the collection
    to a place where ansible-core can find it, for example by cloning the git
    repository, you need to make sure that you also have to install the dependency
    if you are using the inventory plugin
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).
breaking_changes:
  - "robot inventory plugin - ``filters`` is now no longer an alias of ``simple_filters``, but a new, different option
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101)."
removed_features:
  - "The collection no longer supports Ansible, ansible-base, and ansible-core releases
     that are currently End of Life at the time of the 2.0.0 release. This means that
     Ansible 2.9, ansible-base 2.10, ansible-core 2.11, ansible-core 2.12, ansible-core 2.13,
     and ansible-core 2.14 are no longer supported. The collection might still work with these
     versions, but it can stop working at any moment without advance notice, and this will not
     be considered a bug
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101)."
minor_changes:
  - "robot inventory plugin - add ``filter`` option which allows to include and exclude
     hosts based on Jinja2 conditions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101)."
