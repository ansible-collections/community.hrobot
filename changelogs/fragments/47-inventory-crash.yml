bugfixes:
  - "robot inventory plugin - do not crash if a server neither has name or primary IP set. Instead, fall back to using the server's number as the name. This can happen if unnamed rack reservations show up in your server list (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/40, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/47)."
