minor_changes:
  - "firewall, firewall_info - add ``server_number`` option that can be used instead of ``server_ip`` to identify the server. Hetzner deprecated configuring the firewall by ``server_ip``, so using ``server_ip`` will stop at some point in the future (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/77)."
