minor_changes:
- "firewall - rename option ``whitelist_hos`` to ``allowlist_hos``, keep old name as alias (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/15)."
- "firewall, firewall_info - add return value ``allowlist_hos``, which contains the same value as ``whitelist_hos``. The old name ``whitelist_hos`` will be removed eventually (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/15)."
