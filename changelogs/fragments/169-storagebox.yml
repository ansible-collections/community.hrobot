minor_changes:
  - "storagebox_subaccount - support the new Hetzner API. Note that the new API does not support setting a random password;
     you must always provide a password when using the new API to create a storagebox (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/168)."
  - "storagebox_subaccount - no longer mark ``password_mode`` as ``no_log`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/168)."
  - "storagebox_subaccount_info - support the new Hetzner API (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/168)."
