known_issues:
  - "storagebox* modules - the Hetzner Robot API for storage boxes is
     `deprecated and will be sunset on July 30, 2025 <https://docs.hetzner.cloud/changelog#2025-06-25-new-api-for-storage-boxes>`__.
     The modules are currently not compatible with the new API. We will try to adjust them until then,
     but usage and return values might change slightly due to differences in the APIs.

     For the new API, an API token needs to be registered and provided as ``hetzner_token``
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/166)."
minor_changes:
  - "storagebox_info - support the new Hetzner API (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/166)."
