known_issues:
  - "storagebox* modules - the Hetzner Robot API for storage boxes is
     `deprecated and will be sunset on July 30, 2025 <https://docs.hetzner.cloud/changelog#2025-06-25-new-api-for-storage-boxes>`__.
     The modules are currently not compatible with the new API. We will try to adjust them until then,
     but usage and return values might change slightly due to differences in the APIs.

     For the new API, an API token needs to be registered and provided as ``hetzner_token``
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/166)."
minor_changes:
  - "storagebox - support the new Hetzner API (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/166)."
  - "storagebox_info - support the new Hetzner API (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/166)."
  - >-
    Introduced a new action group (module defaults group) ``community.hrobot.api`` that includes all modules that support the new Hetzner API.
    This is currently limited to a subset of the storage box modules; these currently support both the ``community.hrobot.robot``
    and the new ``community.hrobot.api`` action group, and will eventually drop the ``community.hrobot.robot`` action group once
    the Robot API for storage boxes is removed by Hetzner
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/166,
     https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/167,
     https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/168).
