minor_changes:
  - "firewall, firewall_info - add ``filter_ipv6`` and ``rules.output`` output to support the new IPv6 filtering and output rules features (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/75, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/76)."
major_changes:
  - "firewall - Hetzner added output rules support to the firewall. This change unfortunately means that using old versions of the firewall module will always set the output rule list to empty, thus disallowing the server to send out packets (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/75, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/76)."
