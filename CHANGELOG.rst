v2.0.2
======

Release Summary
---------------

Maintenance release with updated documentation.

v2.0.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

- boot - use PHP array form encoding when sending multiple ``authorized_key`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/112, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/113).

v2.0.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

New major release 2.0.0.

Major Changes
-------------

- The ``community.hrobot`` collection now depends on the ``community.library_inventory_filtering_v1`` collection. This utility collection provides host filtering functionality for inventory plugins. If you use the Ansible community package, both collections are included and you do not have to do anything special. If you install the collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install``, it will be installed automatically. If you install the collection by copying the files of the collection to a place where ansible-core can find it, for example by cloning the git repository, you need to make sure that you also have to install the dependency if you are using the inventory plugin (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).

Minor Changes
-------------

- robot inventory plugin - add ``filter`` option which allows to include and exclude hosts based on Jinja2 conditions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- robot inventory plugin - ``filters`` is now no longer an alias of ``simple_filters``, but a new, different option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).

Removed Features (previously deprecated)
----------------------------------------

- The collection no longer supports Ansible, ansible-base, and ansible-core releases that are currently End of Life at the time of the 2.0.0 release. This means that Ansible 2.9, ansible-base 2.10, ansible-core 2.11, ansible-core 2.12, and ansible-core 2.13 are no longer supported. The collection might still work with these versions, but it can stop working at any moment without advance notice, and this will not be considered a bug (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).

v1.9.2
======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

- inventory plugins - add unsafe wrapper to avoid marking strings that do not contain ``{`` or ``}`` as unsafe, to work around a bug in AWX (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/102).

v1.9.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix release.

Security Fixes
--------------

- robot inventory plugin - make sure all data received from the Hetzner robot service server is marked as unsafe, so remote code execution by obtaining texts that can be evaluated as templates is not possible (https://www.die-welt.net/2024/03/remote-code-execution-in-ansible-dynamic-inventory-plugins/, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/99).

v1.9.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature and maintenance release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- robot inventory plugin - the ``filters`` option has been renamed to ``simple_filters``. The old name still works until community.hrobot 2.0.0. Then it will change to allow more complex filtering with the ``community.library_inventory_filtering_v1`` collection's functionality (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/94).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- robot inventory plugin - the ``filters`` option has been renamed to ``simple_filters``. The old name will stop working in community.hrobot 2.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/94).

v1.8.2
======

Release Summary
---------------

Maintenance release with updated documentation.

Bugfixes
--------

- Show more information (if available) from error messages (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/89).

v1.8.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

Maintenance release with updated documentation.

From this version on, community.hrobot is using the new `Ansible semantic markup
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html#semantic-markup-within-module-documentation>`__
in its documentation. If you look at documentation with the ansible-doc CLI tool
from ansible-core before 2.15, please note that it does not render the markup
correctly. You should be still able to read it in most cases, but you need
ansible-core 2.15 or later to see it as it is intended. Alternatively you can
look at `the devel docsite <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/community/hrobot/>`__
for the rendered HTML version of the documentation of the latest release.

Known Issues
------------

- Ansible markup will show up in raw form on ansible-doc text output for ansible-core before 2.15. If you have trouble deciphering the documentation markup, please upgrade to ansible-core 2.15 (or newer), or read the HTML documentation on https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/community/hrobot/.

v1.8.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature release for the Hetzner firewall changes.

Major Changes
-------------

- firewall - Hetzner added output rules support to the firewall. This change unfortunately means that using old versions of the firewall module will always set the output rule list to empty, thus disallowing the server to send out packets (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/75, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/76).

Minor Changes
-------------

- firewall, firewall_info - add ``filter_ipv6`` and ``rules.output`` output to support the new IPv6 filtering and output rules features (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/75, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/76).
- firewall, firewall_info - add ``server_number`` option that can be used instead of ``server_ip`` to identify the server. Hetzner deprecated configuring the firewall by ``server_ip``, so using ``server_ip`` will stop at some point in the future (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/77).

v1.7.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature release.

New Modules
-----------

v1.5.2
======

Release Summary
---------------

Maintenance release with a documentation improvement.

Minor Changes
-------------

v1.5.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Maintenance release changing the way licenses are declared. No functional changes.

Minor Changes

---------------

Bugfixes

- robot inventory plugin - do not crash if a server neither has name or primary IP set. Instead, fall back to using the server's number as the name. This can happen if unnamed rack reservations show up in your server list (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/issues/40, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/47).
